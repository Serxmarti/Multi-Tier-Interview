This document I think that wasn't needed but I felt that it would help to leave a proposal for the subneting needed in this case, it's not a very detailed division of subnets since maybe some zone could be samller due to less scalability needed.

- VPC CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
- Availability Zones: Assume eu-south-2a, eu-south-2b, eu-south-2c

Subnet Configuration
Divide the VPC into multiple subnets, each serving a specific purpose, they are distributed across different AZs for redundancy.

Public Subnets
Used for internet-facing components such as the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Bastion Hosts.

    Subnet 1 (Public, eu-south-2a): 10.0.1.0/24
    Subnet 2 (Public, eu-south-2b): 10.0.2.0/24
    Subnet 3 (Public, eu-south-2c): 10.0.3.0/24

Private Subnets
Used for application servers and backend services. These subnets do not have direct internet access.

    Subnet 4 (Private, eu-south-2a): 10.0.4.0/24
    Subnet 5 (Private, eu-south-2b): 10.0.5.0/24
    Subnet 6 (Private, eu-south-2c): 10.0.6.0/24

Database Subnets
Isolated subnets specifically for the RDS instances to enhance security.

    Subnet 7 (DB, eu-south-2a): 10.0.7.0/24
    Subnet 8 (DB, eu-south-2b): 10.0.8.0/24
    Subnet 9 (DB, eu-south-2c): 10.0.9.0/24

Logging and Management Subnets
Used for centralized logging, monitoring, and management services.

    Subnet 10 (Logging, eu-south-2a): 10.0.10.0/24
    Subnet 11 (Logging, eu-south-2b): 10.0.11.0/24
    Subnet 12 (Logging, eu-south-2c): 10.0.12.0/24

Route Tables
Configure route tables to control traffic flow between subnets and to the internet.

Public Route Table
    - Attached to: Public Subnets (1, 2, 3)
    - Routes:
        Local VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
        Internet Gateway: 0.0.0.0/0 (via Internet Gateway)

Private Route Table
    - Attached to: Private Subnets (4, 5, 6)
    - Routes:
        Local VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
        NAT Gateway: 0.0.0.0/0 (via NAT Gateway in Public Subnets)

Database Route Table
    - Attached to: Database Subnets (7, 8, 9)
    - Routes:
        Local VPC: 10.0.0.0/16

Logging Route Table
    - Attached to: Logging Subnets (10, 11, 12)
    - Routes:
        Local VPC: 10.0.0.0/16


Security Groups

1. ALB Security Group:

    Inbound: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from 0.0.0.0/0
    Outbound: Allow all

2. App Server Security Group:

    Inbound: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from ALB SG, SSH (22) from Bastion SG
    Outbound: Allow all

3. Database Security Group:

    Inbound: MySQL/Aurora (3306) from App Server SG
    Outbound: Allow all

4. Bastion Security Group:

    Inbound: SSH (22) from trusted IP range
    Outbound: Allow all

Network ACLs

1. Public Subnets NACL:

    Inbound: Allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22)
    Outbound: Allow all

2. Private Subnets NACL:

    Inbound: Allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and MySQL (3306)
    Outbound: Allow all

3. Database Subnets NACL:

    Inbound: Allow MySQL (3306) from private subnets
    Outbound: Allow all

Network Flow
1. Inbound Traffic:

    Traffic enters the VPC through the ALB, which is in the public subnets.
    The ALB forwards traffic to the application servers in the private subnets.

2. Application Tier to Database Tier:

    Application servers communicate with the RDS instances in the database subnets.
    This communication is restricted by security groups to allow only the necessary traffic.

3. Outbound Traffic:

    Instances in the private subnets access the internet via the NAT Gateway for updates and patches.
    Logging and monitoring data are sent to CloudWatch from all instances and services.
