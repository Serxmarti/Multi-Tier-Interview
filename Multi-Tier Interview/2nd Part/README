To deploy a new security tool to every EC2 instance in an enterprise-level platform, I would recommend an AWS native tool, AWS Systems Manager (SSM), it integrates well with AWS Secrets Manager for securely managing sensitive information.

Steps for Deployment

1. Set up AWS Systems Manager (SSM):
    - Ensure that the SSM Agent is installed and running on all EC2 instances.
    - Attach the necessary IAM roles to EC2 instances to allow SSM operations.

2. Store sensitive information in AWS Secrets Manager:
    - Store the security agent's license key, API key, or any other sensitive configuration data in AWS Secrets Manager with this command.
        aws secretsmanager create-secret --name CrowdStrikeApiKey --secret-string "YOUR_API_KEY"

3. Create a Systems Manager Document (SSM Document):
    - Define the commands and scripts needed to install and configure the security agent and save the JSON content to a file named InstallCrowdStrike.json (example attached).
    - Use Systems Manager Run Command:
        aws ssm create-document --name "InstallCrowdStrike" --document-type "Command" --content file://InstallCrowdStrike.json

4. Execute the SSM Document across all targeted EC2 instances.
    - Use the SSM Run Command to execute the document on all target EC2 instances. Adjust the --targets parameter to match your instance tagging strategy.
        aws ssm send-command --document-name "InstallCrowdStrike" --targets "Key=tag:Name,Values=your-instance-tag" --comment "Installing CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor"
